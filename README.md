# Proposals
My ideas for my final project are...

Week 4 – Create a basic web app with a (Recipe +) button that opens a form to create the recipe and some input validation – Some UI design and learn how to incorporate Food Nutrition API (https://esha.com/products/nutrition-database-api/) or (https://developer.edamam.com/food-database-api-docs) or (https://www.calorieking.com/us/en/developers/food-api/)
 
Week 5 – Flesh out Recipe Book object to hold Recipe objects and flesh out a Recipe object and figure out all the functionality you’d want accessible to the Recipe object + implement
 
Recipe Book object:
1. 	Add new Recipe objects
2. 	Delete Recipe objects
3. 	Display all recipes
 
Recipe object:
1. 	Add line to recipe
2. 	Support unit conversion
3. 	Serving size
4. 	Return total calorie count
5. 	Return a fraction of the calorie count
6. 	Allow editing to each individual line (name or calorie count)
 
Week 6 – Finish some more functionality from Week 5, make ability to create user profiles and authentication + sharing/exporting capabilities
 
Week 7 - Figure out ideal database to store the recipes given (MongoDB for sheets?) and add functionality to RecipeBook object to read and populate from Mongo
 
Week 8 – Host on Heroku? AWS? + continue/finish MongoDB
